# Activity over Email, and ARFE

This repository includes work-in-progress proposals for two related protocols.

[Activity over Email][] describes use of [Activity Streams 2.0][] documents as
primary content parts in email messages.

[ARFE][] is a data format that enables an interpretation of an email
conversation where messages can be modified by other messages.
